# c_parser

I wrote this program for a computer science course: Programming Languages. I actually wrote this in pieces/steps over the course of a semester. I believe there were 8 assignments in total, each building on the previous -- so if your previous assignments didn't work you'd be in major trouble. This was actually pretty tricky for me, as it was really my first time writting in C after spending so much time writting in C++. It was extra challenging writing in steps, and not knowing what the next step would require. On more than one occasion, I found myself having to back track and rewrite portions of code as they wouldn't work well with the new functionality. 

It was a unique exercise, and I'm grateful for the challenges. 

As with all my code, do NOT use it to cheat -- feel free to get ideas, but write something better.
